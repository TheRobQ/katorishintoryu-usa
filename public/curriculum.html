          <h3>Joining the Tradition</h3>
          <p>
            Even today, those interested in joining the tradition must sign a “Blood Oath”, Keppan, to the Deity of Katori JIngu and to Marishiten, a Buddhist Deity.  Keppan, is a tradition that has been transmitted for generations in Katori Shinto-ryu and in many martial arts ryu in Japan.  In Katori Shinto-ryu it ensures that aspiring students understand the correct View with which they are expected to approach entry to and study within the tradition. Applicants pledge to uphold the following rules:
          </p>
          <h3>Oath to the Supreme Dieties</h3>
          <p>
            On becoming a member of the Tenshinshō-den Katori Shintō-ryū, which has been transmitted by the Great Deity of the Katori Shrine, I herewith affirm my pledge that:</p>
            <p>
              1. I will not have the impertinence to discuss or demonstrate details of the ryu to either non-members or members, even if they are relatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. I will not engage in altercations or misuse the art against others;
            </p>
            <p>
              3. I will not engage in any kind of gambling or frequent disreputable places;
            </p>
              <p>
                4. I will not cross swords with any followers of other martial traditions without authorization
              </p>
            <p>
              I hereby pledge to firmly adhere to each of the above articles. Should I break any of these articles I will submit to the punishment of the Great Deity of Katori and the Great Deity Marishiten. Herewith I solemnly swear and affix my blood seal to this oath to these Great Deities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once completed, the applicant is recognized as a member of the tradition, with the pledge serving to teach them the correct approach toward the tradition and the learning process.
            </p>
            <h3>Learning Process</h3>
            <p>
              Colorado students of Katori Shinto-ryu will follow the learning process as it is done in Japan.  Students are taught kata (pre-arranged routines) that are studied and practiced together with more senior practitioners under the supervision of their teacher. Training consists of kata practice which contain the art’s quintessence, and enables students to gradually acquire the art’s technical, theoretical and philosophical approach. The first kata learned in the ryu are Omote no Tachi (swordsmanship: 4 kata), Omote Iaijutsu (sword drawing: 6 kata), Tachiai Battōjutsu (standing sword drawing: 5 kata), Omote no Bōjutsu (staff techniques: 6 kata), and Omote no Naginata (halberd techniques: 4 kata).
            </p>
            <p>
              Students practice these kata in earnest over many months and years, and are eventually introduced to a wider range of instruction in the curriculum of the art.  Practitioners are awarded scrolls (Mokuroku, Menkyo, and Gokui Kaiden) in line with their development.
