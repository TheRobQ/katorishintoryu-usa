            <p class="lead">Training in any martial art requires dedication, hard work and commitment.  Those words are easy to throw around, but it is the reality of being involved in martial arts, particularly a Koryu art such as Katori Shinto-ryu.  There is no room for fantasy in Katori Shinto-ryu.  Being involved in a Koryu does not cater to students seeking to live in a fantasy of being a Samurai, a “Warrior” or such delusion.  Koryu is not Cosplay.  </p>

          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>Katori Shinto-ryu does offer something to students seeking to cultivate themselves in body, mind and spirit.  Colorado students of Katori Shinto-ryu are expected to learn the physical movements, culture, history etc. that are associated with an art such as this.  It is hard physical training and there is much non-physical learning as well.  Students are expected to be serious in their pursuit.  The group in Colorado will seek to foster the same type of training environment that is found in most Koryu dojo in general and the Shinbukan dojo in Japan specifically.
            </p>
            <p>
              Choisai-sensei passed away at the age of 102 and left us this tradition. Otake Risuke-sensei stresses that the founder not only gave us a tradition but left a legacy. It consists not only of a curriculum of techniques but of values that help develop a human being. Colorado students of Katori Shinto-ryu will follow and aspire to live by the values the Founder, Choisai-sensei, passed on.  These values:  courage, discipline, patience, self-sacrifice, etiquette and courtesy, hard work and commitment are passed on and taught by Otake Risuke-sensei at the Shinbukan dojo in Japan.  The Colorado dojo attempts to instill these values on its students.
